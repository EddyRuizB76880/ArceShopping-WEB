# ArceShopping-WEB
This is a personal project that replicates every functionality seen on the [ArceShopping android app](https://github.com/EddyRuizB76880/ArceShopping), using Angular.
This project is completely functional at this point, however, some work still needs to be done on the CSS files and some testing is in order too.

## Used technologies
- Angular v10: Front end framework used for the project in general. 
- Google's Firebase: Cloud hosted service provided by Google. Its authentication, database, and storage services are used on ArceShopping-WEB.
- Capacitor: Library of API's that enables devs to access a device's built-in functionalities. In this case, Capacitor's camera, Google Maps, and Action-Sheet API's were used.
